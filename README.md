## Introduction
Go-With-STL is a data struct and algorithm library for `golang` using generics, not completely similar to `C++` STL. To be honest, it's not really an STL, not even tiny. I haven't found a good way to separate iterators from containers because there's no way to compare and reflect generics, right. May achieve it in the future, who knows? XD
